    <div class="info">
      <h3>note:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This game is still heavy under development, there are bound to be
          issues
        </li>
        <li>The quicker issues are reported, the faster they can be fixed</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Display:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you are facing issues with display of the game, consider using your
          brower's built-in full-screen mode usually it is f11
        </li>

        <li>
          Be sure you aren't zoomed in or out because that migth cause some
          problems
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Tower info:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your tower has a basic health stat, each fresh game start has a tower
          with a base hp of 100 and progresses with upgrades
        </li>
        <li>Tower health resets after every wave, win or loss</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Orc info:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Each orc has a starting health of 30</li>
        <li>
          The orc's health attribute advances with every increment of waves and
          becomes more and more difficult to eliminate
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Waves:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Upon COMPLETING a wave, you are rewarded with 1 currency or orc coins
        </li>
        <li>
          Wave completion resets all default stats and a new wave will start
          when you start it
        </li>
        <li>
          Logic is definitely going to be changing from the current state of
          waves
        </li>
      </ul>
